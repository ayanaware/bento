### What is a Bento "Component"?

Bento indroduces a concept of components. Components are logical chunks of code that all work together to provide your application to the world.

Components should not take on more then required. (IE: instead of having one component for connecting to Discord and processing messages. Have two, one for the connection and one that handles messages)
