# Example bento-events

This example teaches you about Component events.

Bento has it's own internal event system called Component Events. Component Events should
be used for any and all events between components. To this end Bento provides various helpers
to convert "normal" eventemitter events to ComponentEvents. This example showcases that and some
decorators as well.
